          The Olin College of Engineering is a crazy neat undergraduate, engineering school located just outside of Boston, MA!
          Our curriculum is based entirely on project-based learning - we don't have tests.

        <h2>MIT COVID-19 Hackathon Winners!</h2>
        <p>
          On a whim, I decided to team up with an old high school friend and compete in MIT's COVID-19 virtual hackathon, from April 3rd-6th. With a little luck, a lot of mentor interviews, and some very last minute software development, the Hospital PPE Inventory Management software we built won us a prize in the hackathon's supply chain track!

        <h2>Olin Electric Motorsports</h2>
        <p>
          During my first semester @ Olin College, I decided to join Olin Electric Motorsports (OEM), Olin's Formula SAE team that works to build an electric racecar every year. During my time on OEM, I've worked on designing and testing a more efficient low voltage battery back and battery management system PCB.

        <p>
          Early in my time at Olin, I decided I wanted to work on a socially impactful entrepreneurial venture. Working with my co-founder, Eamon Ito-Fisher, we are developing software to enable project-based learning in higher-ed engineering & CS classrooms and lecture halls.

        <h2>Hemingway</h2>
        <p>
          Over the summer of 2019, I co-founded a business venture in the college applications space, the Hemingway Summer Workshop. Through sixteen hours of instruction over the course of a month, my business partner Sarah Zhou and I were able to teach our students how to approach various types of college essays and how to create personalized roadmaps to break down the college application process. To set up the venture, we self-automated our email campaign, built a social media following, and composed a business strategy & pricing structure from the ground up. Weâ€™re looking forward to expanding next year!
