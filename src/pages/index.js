        <h2>Check out our autonomous maze solving differential drive robot!</h2>
        <p>We built a robot to complete the MicroMouse Competition! Our custom differential drive bot autonomously navigates and solves a 16x16 maze, returns to its starting point by generating a path from its understanding of the maze, and pathplans an optimized route for a final thrilling speedrun to the center. Check out <a href={"http://gammafla.me/micro_mouse_final/"} target="_blank">our project website</a> to learn more! Project features ROS, Gazebo, and Python, with graph theory, path planning, and high speed robot motion control.</p>

        <h2>Edual</h2>
        <p>
          Early in my time at Olin, I decided I wanted to work on a socially impactful entrepreneurial venture. Working with Eamon Ito-Fisher, we reimagined & developed Corewars, an algorithmic thinking game played in Assembly, to enable project-based learning in higher-ed engineering & CS classrooms and lecture halls.
        </p>
        <p> 

        </p>
        <p>We deployed our code to a university in India in January 2020, and you can see the final product above! Read more about our work on Edual <a href={"/blog/corewars-in-india"}>at our full blog post</a>!</p>
