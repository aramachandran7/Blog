        <h2>Check out our autonomous maze solving differential drive robot!</h2>
        <p>We built a robot to complete the MicroMouse Competition! Our custom differential drive bot autonomously navigates and solves a 16x16 maze, returns to its starting point by generating a path from its understanding of the maze, and pathplans an optimized route for a final thrilling speedrun to the center. Check out <a href={"http://gammafla.me/micro_mouse_final/"} target="_blank">our project website</a> to learn more! Project features ROS, Gazebo, and Python, with graph theory, path planning, and high speed robot motion control.</p>

        <h2>Olin Electric Motorsports</h2>
        <p>OEM is our Olin's Formula SAE team that works to build an electric racecar every year! </p>
        <h4>Testing Subteam Lead</h4>
        <p>
          I currently <b>lead the Testing Subteam</b> where I manage and architect projects like our Hardware in the Loop system, our Battery Management System testing rig, and more!
        </p>
        <h4>Low Voltage battery management system</h4>
        <p>
          I'm currently designing and testing the battery management system for our vehicle 12V electrical system featuring a <b>bidirectionalload switch in the high current path, voltage, current, and temperature checking for the pack, & passive cell balancing</b>! The PCB is designed around the LTC6810 chip - I also configured the custom battery pack!

        </p>        
        <h4>Vehicle telemetry software!</h4>
        <p>
          During my second year on OEM, I wrote firmware for and built the data pipeline behind our team's <b> new telemetry system,</b> to live-stream sensor data from the vehicle's CAN bus for visualization, logging, and analysis on the sidelines.

        <p>
          We rebuilt Corewars and used it to teach computer science students in India! (We also reached the front page of <a href={"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25549290"} target="_blank">Hacker News</a>!)

        <h2>Power Electronics at Olin</h2>
        <p>
          Power Electronics is one of my favorite courses at Olin - we learn the theory of different power conversion architectures - buck, buck boost, flyback - and build up our own printed circuit boards to test and understand behavior of those architectures in the real world!
