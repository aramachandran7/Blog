          We wrote some code to help our cleaning robot locate itself in a known physical map using the in built LIDAR sensor and some math. Check out <a href={"/blog/particle-filter"}>the blog post</a> to learn more!</p>

        <h2>Olin Electric Motorsports</h2>
        <p>
          I also spend a lot of time on Olin Electric Motorsports (OEM), Olin's Formula SAE team that works to build an electric racecar every year. During my first year, I worked on designing and testing a more efficient low voltage battery back and associated battery management system PCB. 
        </p>
        <p>
          During my second year on OEM, I've been working on writing the software and building the data pipeline behind our team's <b> new telemetry system,</b> to live-stream sensor data from the vehicle's CANbus for visualization, logging, and analysis on the sidelines.

        <p>
          Early in my time at Olin, I decided I wanted to work on a socially impactful entrepreneurial venture. Working with Eamon Ito-Fisher, we reimagined & developed Corewars, an algorithmic thinking game played in Assembly, to enable project-based learning in higher-ed engineering & CS classrooms and lecture halls.
        </p>
        <p> 

        </p>
        <p>We deployed our code to a university in India in January 2020, and you can see the final product above! Read more about our work on Edual <a href={"/blog/corewars-in-india"}>at our full blog post</a>!</p>

          Over the summer of 2019, I co-founded a business venture in the college applications space, the Hemingway Summer Workshop. Through sixteen hours of instruction over the course of a month, my business partner Sarah Zhou and I were able to teach our students how to approach various types of college essays and how to create personalized roadmaps to break down the college application process. To set up the venture, we self-automated our email campaign, built a social media following, and composed a business strategy & pricing structure from the ground up. Weâ€™re looking forward to expanding next year!
