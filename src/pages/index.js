        <h4>Smart Ring Wearable PCB - low power, 12x20mm footprint </h4>
        <p>
          In STEP, an insane experimental course that Olin offered in spring '22, we designed and validated a complete embedded system to be used in a two finger smart ring. The ring's accelerometer would transmit gestures over bluetooth to allow for <b>screen free control</b> of a user's smartphone, which is particularly relevant to the blind and visually impaired community (blog post coming soon!). 
        </p>
        <p> 
          The hardware itself was straightforward, designed around the <code>STM32WB55xx</code> uC with a 6 axis <code>LSM6DSOxx</code> acceleromter/gyro, a 2.4Ghz BLE chip antenna, and a <code>BQ297xx</code> single cell battery protection IC. Designing within such a small footprint and with the power consumption constraints of a wearable was quite exciting. See <a href={"https://github.com/OlinSTEP/step-devices/tree/main/projects/ring/"} target="_blank">Github page</a> for board files.

        <h4>Check out our autonomous maze solving differential drive robot!</h4>
        <p>We built a robot to complete the MicroMouse Competition! Our custom differential drive bot autonomously navigates and solves a 16x16 maze, returns to its starting point by generating a path from its understanding of the maze, and pathplans an optimized route for a final thrilling speedrun to the center. Check out <a href={"https://github.com/aramachandran7/micro_mouse_final"} target="_blank">our Github</a> to learn more! Project features ROS, Gazebo, and Python, with graph theory, path planning, and high speed robot motion control.</p>

        <h4>Olin Electric Motorsports (Formula SAE Electric)</h4>
        <p>OEM is our Olin's Formula SAE team that works to build an electric racecar every year! </p>
        <p><i>Testing Subteam Lead</i></p>
        <p>
          I previously <b>led the Testing Subteam</b> where I managed and architected projects like our Hardware in the Loop system, our Battery Management System testing rig, and more!
        </p>
        <p><i>Low Voltage battery management system</i></p>
        <p>
          I designed & validated the battery management system for our car's LV bus featuring a <b>bidirectional load switch in the high current path, voltage, current, and temperature sense for the 4s6p pack, & passive cell balancing</b>! The PCB is designed around the <code>LTC6810</code> ASIC - I also configured the custom battery pack!

        </p>        
        <p><i>Vehicle telemetry software</i></p>
        <p>
          During my second year on OEM, I wrote firmware for and built the data pipeline behind our team's <b> new telemetry system,</b> to live-stream sensor data from the vehicle's CAN bus for visualization, logging, and analysis on the sidelines.

        <h4>Corewars</h4>
        <p>
          We rebuilt Corewars and used it to teach computer science students in India! (We also reached the front page of <a href={"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25549290"} target="_blank">Hacker News</a>!)  
        </p>
        <p> 
        </p>
        <p>This is one of my favorite projects, and getting to actually deploy it to a university in India in January 2020 was incredible. You can see the final product above! Read more about our work <a href={"/blog/corewars-in-india"}>at our full blog post</a>!</p>

        <h4>Flywheel & Motor Controller Design!</h4>
        <p>
          We simulated, designed, & built a 9kg flywheel capable of storing .74Wh of energy. I worked with another student on the design of a 400W 60V inverter for the BLDC motor.

        <h4>We built a particle filter!</h4>
        <p>
          We wrote some code to help our cleaning robot locate itself in a known physical map using the in built LIDAR sensor and some math. Check out <a href={"/blog/particle-filter"}>the blog post</a> to learn more!</p>

        <h4>Power Electronics at Olin</h4>
        <p>
          Power Electronics is one of my favorite courses at Olin - we learn the theory of different power conversion architectures - buck, buck boost, flyback - and build up our own printed circuit boards to test and understand behavior of those architectures in the real world!
