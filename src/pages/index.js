          The Olin College of Engineering is a crazy neat undergraduate, engineering school located just outside of Boston, MA!
          Our curriculum is based entirely on project-based learning - we don't have tests.

        <h2>Hemingway</h2>
        <p>
          Over this past summer, I co-founded a business venture in the college applications space, the Hemingway Summer Workshop. Through sixteen hours of instruction over the course of a month, my business partner Sarah Zhou and I were able to teach our students how to approach various types of college essays and how to create personalized roadmaps to break down the college application process. To set up the venture, we self-automated our email campaign, built a social media following, and composed a business strategy & pricing structure from the ground up. Weâ€™re looking forward to expanding next year!

        <p>
          Early in my time at Olin, I decided I wanted to work on a socially impactful entrepreneurial venture. Working with my co-founder, Eamon Ito-Fisher, we are developing software to enable project-based learning in higher-ed engineering & CS classrooms and lecture halls.
