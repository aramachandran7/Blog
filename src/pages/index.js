        <h2>Smart Ring Wearable PCB - low power, 12x20mm footprint </h2>
        <p>
          In this insane experimental course that Olin offered in spring '22, we designed and validated a complete embedded system to be used in a two finger smart ring. The ring's accelerometer would transmit gestures over bluetooth to allow for <b>screen free control</b> of a user's smartphone, which is particularly relevant to the blind and visually impaired community (blog post coming soon!). 
        </p>
        <p> 
          The hardware itself was straightforward, designed around the <code>STM32WB55xx</code> uC with a 6 axis <code>LSM6DSOxx</code> acceleromter/gyro, a 2.4Ghz BLE chip antenna, and a <code>BQ297xx</code> single cell battery protection IC. Designing within such a small footprint and with the power consumption constraints of a wearable was quite exciting. See <a href={"https://github.com/OlinSTEP/step-devices/tree/main/projects/ring/"} target="_blank">Github page</a> for board files.

        <h2>Check out our autonomous maze solving differential drive robot!</h2>
        <p>We built a robot to complete the MicroMouse Competition! Our custom differential drive bot autonomously navigates and solves a 16x16 maze, returns to its starting point by generating a path from its understanding of the maze, and pathplans an optimized route for a final thrilling speedrun to the center. Check out <a href={"https://github.com/aramachandran7/micro_mouse_final"} target="_blank">our Github</a> to learn more! Project features ROS, Gazebo, and Python, with graph theory, path planning, and high speed robot motion control.</p>

        <h2>Olin Electric Motorsports (Formula SAE Electric)</h2>
        <p>OEM is our Olin's Formula SAE team that works to build an electric racecar every year! </p>
        <h4>Testing Subteam Lead</h4>
        <p>
          I previously <b>led the Testing Subteam</b> where I managed and architected projects like our Hardware in the Loop system, our Battery Management System testing rig, and more!
        </p>
        <h4>Low Voltage battery management system</h4>
        <p>
          I designed & validated the battery management system for our car's LV bus featuring a <b>bidirectional load switch in the high current path, voltage, current, and temperature sense for the 4s6p pack, & passive cell balancing</b>! The PCB is designed around the <code>LTC6810</code> ASIC - I also configured the custom battery pack!

        <h4>Vehicle telemetry software!</h4>
        <p>
          During my second year on OEM, I wrote firmware for and built the data pipeline behind our team's <b> new telemetry system,</b> to live-stream sensor data from the vehicle's CAN bus for visualization, logging, and analysis on the sidelines.

        <h2>Corewars</h2>
        <p>
          We rebuilt Corewars and used it to teach computer science students in India! (We also reached the front page of <a href={"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25549290"} target="_blank">Hacker News</a>!)  
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>This is one of my favorite projects, and getting to actually deploy it to a university in India in January 2020 was incredible. You can see the final product above! Read more about our work <a href={"/blog/corewars-in-india"}>at our full blog post</a>!</p>

        <p>
          We simulated, designed, & built a 9kg flywheel capable of storing .74Wh of energy. I worked with another student on the design of a 400W 60V inverter for the BLDC motor.
